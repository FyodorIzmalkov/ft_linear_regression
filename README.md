# ft_linear_regression

pip3 install pandas numpy matplotlib

Program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.
First, run the train.py file it will read the data.csv file and create weights to make a good predictions.
Then run a predict.py file it will give you a prompt to type a milleage , and you will get your price prediction.

Also, there are some flags:
-cost will show a SSE graph
-line will show a final line with final theta1 && theta0
-history will show lines of theta1 && theta0 during execution and calculation
-scatter will show initial graph of data
-error will print average prediction error in percantage
